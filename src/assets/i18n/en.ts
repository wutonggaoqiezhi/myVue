      description:
        'The Three Kingdoms culture constitutes a rare and unignorable cultural heritage in Chinese history. While it is but a fraction of a 5,000-year-old civilization, the era torn by the wars among charismatic history-making warlords and warriors suggests the allegiance, integrity, wisdom and valiance of a great people. In the Wuhou Shrine you can experience the very cultural essence and traditional heritage. A time-honored cultural relic more than 1,790 years old, the shrine has made itself a magnificent, awe-inspiring place well known to people since the entombment of Liu Beisâ€™ remains.',
