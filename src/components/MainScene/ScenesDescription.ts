            content: 'Liu Bei was given the posthumous title Emperor Zhaolie. Since Liu Bei was the founding ruler of the state of Shu Han and forefather of the Shu Han regime, and because he was notable for his staunchness, benevolence, ability to truly understand others and treat them with sincerity, unwavering conviction and ultimate ascension as a state founder, thus the character zhao, or "prominence," is used to describe and commend his virtues. At the same time, to serenade his loyalty to the Han dynasty, his declaration as a descendant of the Han imperial family, his proclaimed responsibility to restore the Han dynasty, his "achievement in bringing peace to the people" and his "upholding of moral values and dedication to his aspiration," the character lie, or "prominence," is used to describe and commend the feats accomplished throughout his life.'

            content: 'Pass the Hall of Liu Bei and go down one flight of steps is the Temple of Marquis Wu. Why is it one flight of steps lower? This is a manifestation of the caste mentality of feudal society, differentiating the superiority of the lord and the inferiority of the vassal. The Temple of Marquis Wu is a shrine built to commemorate Zhuge Liang, the Chancellor and Marquis of Wu District of the Shu Han state of the Three Kingdoms period. During his lifetime Zhuge Liang was named "Marquis of Wu District" and was given the posthumous title "Marquis Zhongwu," thus the shrine constructed to venerate him is called “Wuhou Shrine” or "Temple of Marquis Wu".'
